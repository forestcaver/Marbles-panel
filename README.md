# Marbles-Panel

1. My version of the marbles panel - bitmap, eagle files, gerbers
2. My spreadsheet to calibrate marbles and my version of settings.cc which includes my calibration data for my two modules.
3. Calibration document written by Bu Ma - very clear instructions ! (Reproduced here by kind permission of Bu Ma !)
4. NOTE: When flashing the module make sure to erase flash first.
