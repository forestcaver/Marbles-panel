# Marbles-Panel

1. My version of the marbles panel - bitmap, eagle files, gerbers
2. My spreadsheet to calibrate marbles and my version of settings.cc which includes my calibration data for my two modules.
3. Calibration document written by Bu Ma from some rough notes I sent - his are very clear instructions ! (Reproduced here by kind permission of Bu Ma !)
4. NOTE: When flashing the module make sure to erase flash first.
5. Added a mic803 supervisor, moved recom to the back of the pcb so it doesnt clash with the switch
